Simple Calculator

This project involves creating a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will take input from the user and return the result of the operation.

To create the Simple Calculator:
1. Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
2. Ask the user to choose an operation: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/).
3. Perform the selected operation on the two numbers.
4. Display the result to the user.

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how the calculator works:

1. The user inputs the first number (e.g., 10).
2. The user inputs the second number (e.g., 5).
3. The user chooses an operation (e.g., +).
4. The program calculates the result (e.g., 10 + 5 = 15).
5. The program displays the result (e.g., "The result is 15").
