A Pig Latin converter is a tool or program that translates English words into Pig Latin, a playful form of language often used for fun. Here's how it works:

For words that begin with a consonant or consonant cluster:

    - Move the consonant or consonant cluster from the beginning of the word to the end.
    - Add "ay" to the end of the word.
Example: "hello" becomes "ellohay", "chair" becomes "airchay".


For words that begin with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u):

    - Simply add "way" or "yay" to the end of the word.
Example: "apple" becomes "appleway" or "appleyay".


Example of a Pig Latin Conversion:
English: "chat"
Pig Latin: "atchay"
English: "orange"
Pig Latin: "orangeway"
