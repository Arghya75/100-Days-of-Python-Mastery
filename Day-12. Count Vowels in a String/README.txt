Vowel Counter Program

Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to count the number of vowels in a given input string. The program identifies all the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string, regardless of their case (uppercase or lowercase), and returns the total count of vowels along with a list of all vowels found in the order they appear.

How It Works:
1. The program prompts the user to enter a text string.
2. It iterates through each character in the string, checking if it is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase).
3. If a vowel is found, it is added to a list and the vowel count is incremented.
4. After processing the entire string, the program returns the total number of vowels and a list of the vowels found.
5. The results are displayed, showing the number of vowels and listing each vowel in the order it was found.

Example:
If the user enters the text "Are you student?", the program will output:
There are 6 vowels in 'are you student' and the vowels are ['a', 'e', 'o', 'u', 'u', 'e']
