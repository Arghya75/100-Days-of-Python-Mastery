Factorial Calculator Program

Overview
This program is designed to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to that number. It is a common operation in mathematics, particularly in combinatorics, probability, and algebra.

What is a Factorial?
A factorial, denoted as n!, is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example:
	5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
	4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
	3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
By definition, the factorial of 0 (0!) is equal to 1.

How the Program Works:
Input: The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
Calculation: The program then calculates the factorial of the entered number using a mathematical formula or loop.
Output: The program displays the factorial of the number entered by the user.
