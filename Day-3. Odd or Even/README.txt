Even or Odd Checker

Overview
This script allows users to check whether a given number is odd or even. The program also handles invalid input, ensuring that only valid integers are accepted.

How It Works
1.Functionality: The `is_odd_number` function determines if the input number is odd or even by checking if it is divisible by 2.
    - If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd.
    - If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
   
2.Input Validation: The `valid_input` function ensures that the user enters a valid integer. It repeatedly prompts the user until a correct input is given.

3.Execution: The program prompts the user to enter a number, validates the input, and then prints whether the number is odd or even.

Example Usage:
Enter your number: 7
The given number is odd
