What is Simple Interest?

Simple interest is a way to calculate the interest charge on a loan or investment. It is determined by multiplying the principal amount (the initial sum of money), the interest rate, and the time period for which the money is borrowed or invested. 

The formula for simple interest is:
        simple interest = P * N * (R/100)

Where:
- P is the Principal amount(the initial sum of money).
- N is the Number of years(time period the money is borrowed or invested).
- R is the Rate of interest(annual interest rate).

Simple interest is straightforward to calculate and is often used in short-term loans or investments where the interest doesn't compound over time. Unlike compound interest, where interest is calculated on the initial principal and the accumulated interest over previous periods, simple interest is only calculated on the original principal.

 Purpose of the Program

The purpose of the program is to calculate the amount of simple interest based on user inputs for the principal amount, number of years, and the interest rate.

The program performs the following steps:

1. User Input: It prompts the user to input three values:
   - Principal amount (P)
   - Number of years (N)
   - Rate of interest (R)
   
2. Validation: The program checks if the user inputs are valid numbers. If the input is not a valid number, it prompts the user again until a valid number is entered.

3. Calculation: Once valid inputs are provided, the program uses the simple interest formula to calculate the interest.

4. Output: Finally, it displays the calculated simple interest to the user.
