What is a Leap Year?

A leap year is a year that contains one additional day to help synchronize the calendar year with the solar year, or the length of time it takes for the Earth to complete its orbit around the Sun. Normally, a year has 365 days, but a leap year has 366 days, with the extra day added to the month of February (February 29th). 

The general rules to determine if a year is a leap year are:

1. Divisible by 4: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
2. Divisible by 100: However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless:
3. Divisible by 400: The year is also divisible by 400. If it is, then it is a leap year.

This means that while the years 1600 and 2000 are leap years, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not.

Purpose of the Program

The purpose of the program you shared is to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. 

- The program accepts a year as input from the user.
- It then checks the year against the rules for leap years.
- Based on the rules, the program returns a message indicating whether the input year is a leap year or not.
