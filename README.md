# 100 Days Projects Challenge
*A journey from beginner to advanced Python programming in 100 projects!*

Hello, and welcome to my Python projects repository! This is a space where I document my journey and progress in learning Python by taking on a personal challenge: creating 100 projects, starting with the basics and gradually raising the bar towards more complex tasks. 

## About This Repository
I created this repository to track my growth and improvements in Python programming. Each project is a step forward in my learning journey, designed to challenge my skills and push me toward mastery.  
I've committed to completing 100 Python projects, starting with simple tasks and gradually increasing in difficulty. Each project is contained in its folder, and within each folder, you'll find a `README.txt` file that explains what the project is about. 

### Project Structure
- ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner Projects:** Basic concepts like printing, arithmetic operations, and conditionals.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate Projects:** Complex algorithms, data structures, and real-world applications.
- ðŸ”´ **Advanced Projects:** Advanced concepts and techniques to challenge and refine your skills.
