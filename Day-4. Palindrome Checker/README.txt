Description:

This Python code is designed to check whether a given number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.

How It Works:

Input Handling:

The program asks the user to input a number.
It includes error handling to ensure that the user inputs a valid integer. If the user enters something that isn't a number, the program will continue to prompt the user until a valid integer is entered.
Palindrome Check:

The program converts the number to a string and checks if it reads the same forward and backward.
If the number is a palindrome, the program outputs "It is Palindrome."
If the number is not a palindrome, the program outputs "It is not Palindrome."
Usage:

Run the code, input a number when prompted, and the program will tell you whether the number is a palindrome.
